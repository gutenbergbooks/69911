<h2>Foreword</h2>
</div>


<p>During World War II the photographers of the United States Army, Air
Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard created on film a pictorial
record of immeasurable value. Thousands of their pictures are preserved
in the photographic libraries of the armed services, little seen by the
public.</p>

<p>In the volumes of UNITED STATES ARMY IN WORLD WAR II now being prepared
by the Office of the Chief of Military History, Department of the
Army, it is possible to include only a limited number of pictures. A
subseries of pictorial volumes, of which this is one, has been planned
to supplement the other volumes of the series. The photographs have
been selected to show important terrain features, types of equipment
and weapons, living and weather conditions, military operations, and
various matters of human interest. These volumes will preserve and make
accessible for future reference some of the best pictures of World
War II. An appreciation not only of the terrain on which actions were
fought, but of its influence on the capabilities and limitations of
weapons, in the hands of both our troops and the enemy’s, can be gained
through a careful study of the pictures herein presented. Appreciation
of these factors is essential to a clear understanding of military
history.</p>

<p>This volume, compiled by Lt. Col. John C. Hatlem, USAF, and Capt.
Kenneth E. Hunter, with the assistance of Miss Margaret E. Tackley, and
edited by W. Brooks Phillips and Miss Mary Ann Bacon, deals with the
Mediterranean Theater of Operations and the Middle East. It is divided
into five sections: (1) North Africa and the Middle East; (2) Sicily,
Corsica, and Sardinia; (3) Italy: 9 September 1943–4 June 1944; (4)
Southern France; and (5) Italy: 5 June 1944-2 May 1945. Each section
is arranged in chronological order. The written text has been kept to
a minimum. Each section is preceded by a brief introduction recounting
the major events set down in detail in the individual narrative volumes
of UNITED STATES ARMY IN WORLD WAR II. The appendices give information
as to the abbreviations used and the sources of the photographs.</p>

<h3>North Africa</h3>

<p>The occupation of French North Africa by Allied troops was determined
in July 1942 when the American and British Governments agreed to launch
a Mediterranean operation in the fall of 1942. The invasion, designated
as <span class="smcap">Torch</span>, was to coincide with a British advance westward
from Egypt. Before American soldiers did any actual fighting in North
Africa, however, and before the United States was at war, civilian and
military observers had been informally attached in May 1941 to the U.
S. military attaché in Cairo. This group was the beginning of a force
whose primary function was to service and maintain lend-lease equipment
from the United States, instruct the British in its use, and report on
how it stood up under battle conditions. The U. S. Air Force also was
performing missions in Egypt several months before the Allied landings
in North Africa. All these activities contributed to the British
victory at El Alamein in October 1942.</p>

<p>Allied troops sailed for North Africa from ports in both the United
States and the United Kingdom. The U. S. Navy and the Royal Navy shared
in supplying transports and naval escort and were able to prevent any
serious losses through enemy submarine action. Vital air support was
at first provided from aircraft carriers of both Navies and later by
land-based planes of the Allied air forces utilizing recently captured
airfields.</p>

<p>The Allies hoped to avoid French resistance to the landings by
arranging for the assistance of patriotic Frenchmen ashore and by
the participation in the operation of Gen. Henri Giraud, a French
military leader and former Army commander of great prestige who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
escaped from France. These plans were only partly successful. The
landings on the early morning of 8 November at beaches near Algiers,
Oran, Casablanca, Port-Lyautey, Fedala, and Safi met resistance at all
objectives. The opposition at Algiers and Safi collapsed quickly. Oran
could be occupied only after considerable fighting. French forces,
especially naval elements, in the neighborhood of Casablanca resisted
strongly, but yielded on 11 November, a few minutes before the final
assault on the city itself was to start. After a brief period of
neutrality, most of the French forces in northwest Africa joined in the
war against the Axis.</p>

<p>The Axis reacted to the Allied invasion by rushing troops to Tunisia
by air and sea, and captured the local airfields and ports without
opposition. British, American, and French troops drove eastward and at
the end of November and in early December launched their attack against
the Axis bridgehead. The Allied advance, however, was stopped short of
Tunis. Air superiority for the moment lay with the Axis. Lack of means
to overcome the increased resistance, in addition to weather conditions
which interfered with transport and flying, forced the postponement
until 1943 of a renewed advance over the difficult terrain of northern
Tunisia.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the British Eighth Army was pressing German and Italian
forces back from Egypt through Libya and reached the southern border
of Tunisia in January 1943. Plans could then be perfected for a
co-ordinated attack against the remaining Axis forces in North Africa
by the British Eighth Army in the south and the Allied troops in the
north consisting of the British First Army, the American II Corps,
the French XIX Corps, and Allied air forces. Attack by Axis forces
at points of their own selection repeatedly interfered with Allied
preparations. In February the enemy broke through Faïd Pass and in a
series of attacks advanced beyond Kasserine almost to the Algerian
border. These attacks were stopped on 21–22 February when the enemy
started his withdrawal, destroying bridges and mining the passes behind
him.</p>

<p>But the Allied forces were closing in. After attacking and turning the
Mareth position, the British Eighth Army defeated the enemy there and
pursued him along the coast as far as Enfidaville, less than fifty
miles from Tunis. Accelerated Allied air and naval attacks choked
off the enemy’s supply and weakened his resistance. At the same time
the American II Corps was shifted northwest to a new sector on the
left of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span> the British First Army. Then after severe infantry fighting
the American II Corps made an armored thrust to Mateur, and after a
pause it pushed tank forces east to the sea, separating Bizerte from
Tunis. Farther south the British First Army drove directly toward
Tunis. On 7 May both Bizerte and Tunis were occupied and by 13 May
Axis capitulation was complete. The Allies had achieved their initial
objective of opening the Mediterranean route to the Middle East and
seizing bases in North Africa. At the same time they had inflicted a
major defeat on the Axis Powers.</p>

<p>Allied strength in French North Africa had been brought to a total of
about a million men. Much of this strength was not intended for the
Tunisia Campaign but for later operations against Sicily and southern
Italy. Elaborate training establishments were developed by the American
Fifth and Seventh Armies and vast supply depots established with a view
to future operations from the African base.</p>


<h3>Persian Gulf Command</h3>

<p>In June 1942 an American theater of operations called U. S. Army
Forces in the Middle East was established with headquarters at Cairo.
Under this command were merged various groups and military missions
that had been active in this area since the spring of 1941. American
responsibilities for moving supplies to the Soviet Union led ultimately
to a separation of the Persian Gulf activities of USAFIME and their
establishment under an organization that was known from December 1943
to October 1945 as the Persian Gulf Command, with headquarters at
Tehran, Iran.</p>

<p>From 1941 to 1945 the main business of the U. S. Army in the Middle
East was to facilitate the supply of lend-lease goods to British
and Soviet forces. This task involved the construction of docks,
warehouses, shops, and highways as well as the operation of ports, a
railroad, and a motor transport service in Iran. At the same time the
Army constructed numerous airfields and bases, stretching across Egypt,
the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, Eritrea, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Syria,
Iraq, and Iran.</p>

The landings were made at Fedala, farther north, in order to
attack Casablanca overland partly because of its very strong
defenses and partly because of the necessity of capturing the
port in usable condition. Casablanca was a naval base. The U.
S. Navy had the mission of preventing French warships from
interfering with the landings. American ships came under the
fire of large coastal guns on El Hank Point (in the foreground,
top picture) and engaged in running battles off Casablanca.
Moored in the harbor was the battleship Jean Bart which also
fired heavy shells to drive the American ships from their
protective stations. After three days, when Casablanca was about
to be attacked by ground, air, and sea bombardment and occupied
by tanks and infantry, the city surrendered. The harbor was put
to almost immediate use.</p>

invasion. The ultimate goals for the operation were Bizerte and
Tunis, but because of the land-based enemy aircraft in Sardinia,
Sicily, and southern Italy, it was decided to land no troops
farther east than Algiers until airports had been captured.
British-American elements at Algiers re-embarked for a movement
eastward to Bougie where they landed on 11 November. Bône was
captured the following day by British paratroopers dropped from
C-47’s and by seaborn forces from Bougie. From there the advance
toward Tunis started. Allied columns reached Djedeida, twelve
miles from Tunis, on 29 November 1942, but rapid enemy build-up
forced the Allies to abandon it on 13 December.</p>

knock out Allied tanks before the latter could get within

23 March, the front became almost stabilized until the British
Eighth Army broke through Oued el Akarit defenses along the
coast north of Gabès on the night of 6–7 April. The junction
between the forces fighting in Tunisia and the British Eighth
Army from the Middle East took place on the Gafsa-Gabès road on
7 April when a U. S. armored reconnaissance unit made contact
with elements of the British army. The British Eighth Army had
started its drive westward from El Alamein in Egypt on the
night of 23–24 October 1942 and when the junction was made had
traveled about 1,500 miles.</p>

     <p class="p0 p-left smaller p-small">THE FAMOUS GERMAN EIGHTY-EIGHT. The original weapon, an Austrian
88-mm. cannon, was used in World War I. Restrictions imposed
by the Allies after that war limited German experimentation on
conventional offensive artillery but not on defensive artillery
such as antiaircraft types (in photograph). With different
sets of aiming fire instruments this antiaircraft gun could be
used as an antitank gun or a conventional piece of artillery.
It was tested as an antiaircraft gun under battle conditions
during the Spanish Civil War in 1936. Encountered throughout the
war in increasing numbers, it was probably the most effective
all-around piece of artillery the Germans had. (Left: 8.8-cm.

armor, fired armor-piercing shells loaded with high-explosive
fillers designed to burst inside the armor and to set the
tank on fire. Antitank gun (top) could penetrate the armor of
any Allied tank, front, side, or rear. Both U. S. and British
armor-piercing shells were solid and did not fire the tanks;
thus the Germans were able to salvage damaged armored equipment
to a greater extent than were the Allies. It was not until well
into the Italian campaign that armor-piercing shells equipped
with fuzes and high-explosive fillers became available to Allied
forces. (Top: German antitank gun, 7.5-cm. Pak. 40; bottom:

an adverse psychological effect on troops at the receiving end

sound-ranging equipment could not locate the rocket launchers
because firing did not cause a report. The enemy used this type
of weapon until the end of the war. (15-cm. Nebelwerfer, 41.)</p>

the first few months after the landings, the Allied air forces
were handicapped in their operations from North African bases
through lack of suitable airfields. The lack of all-weather
facilities such as hard-surfaced runways, taxiways, and
hard-stands was particularly serious in the rainy winter season
of 1942–43. In the area from the Atlantic coast of Morocco
to the Tunisian border, there were only four air bases with
any kind of hard-surfaced runways: Port-Lyautey, north of
Casablanca; Tafaraoui, near Oran; Maison Blanche at Algiers; and
the Bone airfield on the coast near the Tunisian border. (B-24.)</p>

<p>The decision to assault Sicily was made by the Chiefs of Staff at
Casablanca in January 1943. After the conclusion of the Tunisia
Campaign, plans were completed and preparations for the attack were
accelerated (Operation <span class="smcap">Husky</span>). The island of Pantelleria,
located between North Africa and Sicily, occupied mainly by Italian
troops, was bombarded by Air Forces and Navy units and fell on 11 June.
Troops for the invasion were embarked from the United States, United
Kingdom, Algeria, Tunisia, and the Middle East.</p>

<p>On the night before D Day, a high wind of near gale proportions was
encountered as the convoys approached their rendezvous. Shortly after H
Hour, 10 July, airborne landings, although scattered by the high wind,
were to some extent successful in their effect on our beach assault.
Three hours after the landing, beachheads were established from Licata
to Scoglitti by the Americans and from Capo Passero to Syracuse by the
British.</p>

<p>Despite the problem of supply during the first two days, by 12 July the
Allied armies had seized the port of Syracuse and ten other Sicilian
towns in addition to several airfields. By the 23d, American tanks and
infantry, driving across the western end of the island, took the key
port of Palermo. The enemy, in the east, lodged in rugged mountain
terrain, offered stiff resistance.</p>

<p>On 25 July King Victor Emmanuel III had announced the resignation of
Premier Benito Mussolini and his cabinet, thereby exposing the weakness
of fascist Italy. Italian resistance had crumbled and in August the
German army started to withdraw to the mainland across the Strait of
Messina.</p>

<p>The British Eighth Army succeeded in taking Catania on the east coast
early in August, and Messina was entered by both American and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span> British
units on the 16th. All organized resistance ceased on 17 August after
thirty-nine days of fighting.</p>

<p>Allied Force Headquarters’ plan for the occupation of Corsica and
Sardinia was confirmed at the Quebec conference held in August 1943.
After the withdrawal of the German forces from Sardinia, the island
fell into Allied hands without a struggle. The French army, given
the mission of taking Corsica, met only slight resistance from the
retreating German troops in October 1943.</p>

<p>Air bases established on both islands provided air coverage for future
operations in northern Italy and southern France.</p>

<p class="center">(9 September 1943–4 June 1944)</p>

<p>The Allied victory in Sicily helped to bring about the surrender of
Italy. The terms of the Italian surrender were signed on 3 September
1943 and announced on the night of the 8th. Allied troops received the
news on shipboard while under way to invade Italy. Fighting did not
cease with the surrender. Instead, the Germans took over the country
with troops on the spot and sent reinforcements. The defeat of the
Germans in Italy would strengthen Allied control over the Mediterranean
shipping lanes and would provide air bases closer to targets in Germany
and enemy-occupied territory. The Allied troops in Italy would also
engage enemy troops which might otherwise have been employed against
the Russians.</p>

<p>On 3 September, elements of the British Eighth Army crossed into Italy
and advanced up the Italian toe in pursuit of the retreating Germans.
On 9 September the main assault was launched when an Anglo-American
force, part of the U. S. Fifth Army, landed on the beaches near
Salerno, south of Naples. Since the enemy had expected landings in the
vicinity of Naples and had disposed his forces accordingly, the Allies
encountered prompt and sustained resistance. By 15 September, however,
the Germans started to withdraw up the Italian Peninsula, pursued on
the west by the Fifth Army and on the east by the Eighth Army. The port
of Naples fell on 1 October and the Foggia airfields about the same
time.</p>

<p>After crossing the Volturno River against stiff resistance, the
Allies advanced to the Winter Line seventy-five miles south of Rome.
In bitterly cold weather the troops slogged through mud and snow to
breach the series of heavy defenses and advanced to the Gustav Line.
In midJanuary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span> the main Fifth Army launched a new offensive across the
Rapido and Garigliano Rivers to pierce the Gustav Line and advance up
the Liri Valley toward Rome. Bridgeheads were secured across the rivers
and footholds were obtained in Cassino and surrounding hills, but no
break-through of the main German positions was effected. A few days
after the initial attack against the Gustav Line, an Anglo-American
amphibious force landed at Anzio and struck inland with the purpose
of compelling the Germans on the southern front to withdraw. But the
Allied beachhead force was contained by the enemy’s unexpectedly rapid
build-up and was hard pressed to stave off several fierce German
counterattacks.</p>

<p>After the Anzio front became stabilized and the effort to take Cassino
was abandoned, the AAI (Allied Armies in Italy) regrouped and launched
a new offensive on 11 May 1944. Fifth Army, led by French troops and
assisted by American troops, broke through the main German positions
in the Arunci Mountains west of the Garigliano River while the Eighth
Army advanced up the Liri Valley. A few days later the beachhead force
effected a junction with the troops from the southern front, and
advanced almost to Valmontone on Highway 6 before the axis of attack
was shifted to the northwest. After several unsuccessful attacks
toward Lanuvio and along the Albano road, the Fifth Army discovered an
unguarded point near Velletri, enveloped the German positions based on
the Alban Hills, and pushed on rapidly toward Rome, which fell on 4
June 1944 with the Germans in full retreat. Meanwhile preparations were
being rushed for an invasion of southern France by Allied troops, most
of them drawn from forces in Italy.</p>

force. The British 10 Corps of this army landed on the
beaches shown in the center of the picture, the U. S. VI
Corps on beaches at Paestum in distance. One division of the
British Eighth Army landed at Taranto in the heel of Italy
simultaneously with the main landings in the Golfo di Salerno.
Just six days before these landings two divisions of the British
Eighth Army had invaded Italy from Sicily. These two armies were
to advance northward: the U. S. army along the west and the
British army along the east side of the peninsula.</p>

from the Rapido River. Hard fighting took place for control of
the road leading from Pozzilli through the mountains to San Elia
in the Rapido Valley. Initial attempts made by U. S. forces to
cross the mountains failed because of the exhaustion of the

replaced by fresh French mountain troops, who in January 1944

tons of bombs were dropped and 195,969 rounds were fired by
artillery ranging in size from 3-inch guns to 240-mm. howitzers.
The enemy’s defenses were not destroyed. Protected by cellars,
steel and concrete pillboxes, caves, and tunnels, the German
troops suffered comparatively few casualties. The bombing and
shelling neither overcame the enemy’s resistance nor noticeably
reduced his morale. When the infantry moved in for the attack
they were met by heavy mortar fire; when the Allied tanks
appeared they could not advance because of bomb craters and
debris. The attack was repulsed.</p>

<span class="subhed">Southern France</span></h2></div>

<p>The offensive operation in southern France, originally scheduled to
be executed simultaneously with the Normandy landings, was conceived
with the aim of pushing northward from the southern coast, creating
a diversion of enemy troops from the northern assault, and generally
weakening the German Army in France. This operation was given the code
name <span class="smcap">Anvil</span>.</p>

<p>A serious shortage of landing craft delayed the invasion until 15
August 1944. Meanwhile preparations for such a landing served as a
threat and held a large number of German forces on the southern coast.
Craft, used first for the Normandy landings, were then rushed to the
Mediterranean for use in mounting <span class="smcap">Anvil</span>.</p>

<p>During June and July three divisions which formed the bulk of the U. S.
VI Corps were withdrawn from the battle in Italy and sent to port areas
for training and for participation in Operation <span class="smcap">Anvil</span>. At the
same time all the French troops with U. S. Fifth Army were withdrawn
to prepare for the invasion. The Allied strategic air forces began the
process of neutralizing vital enemy communications and installations in
southern France. As D Day approached, a large naval force was amassed
in the Mediterranean, and the ground forces, American and French
troops, were embarked from Italy, North Africa, and Corsica.</p>

<p>An airborne task force of American and British units, with the
mission of preventing the enemy from reinforcing the coastal defense,
successfully jumped astride the Argens River behind the German
lines before H Hour. Landings took place on 15 August 1944 in the
Cannes-Toulon sector against scattered and disorganized resistance
from the enemy. The assault forces, assisted by members of the French
Resistance forces, pressed their attack rapidly, defeated the enemy
along the coast line, and pushed inland. The troops were met with
enthusiasm by the French population.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span></p>

<p>Toulon and Marseille were captured by units of the French forces. By
the end of August the combined American and French forces had broken
German resistance in southern France, destroyed and put to flight
the enemy, and advanced to Lyons. On 11 September 1944 they made
junction with the Normandy forces west of Dijon, thereby sealing all of
southwestern France.</p>

<p class="center">(5 June 1944–2 May 1945)</p>

<p>The Allies did not halt after taking Rome, but their northward progress
was soon slowed by skillful delaying tactics of the retreating enemy
and by the fact that all the French and some of the American divisions
were being withdrawn from the U. S. Fifth Army for the operation in
southern France. The Germans speeded construction of the Gothic Line
in the north Apennines, and early in August 1944 the Allies paused for
reorganization on a line running approximately from ten miles north
of Ancona on the east through Pisa to the west coast. The Fifth Army
held the territory south of the Arno River from the sea to a few miles
east of Florence; the British Eighth Army was north of Ancona on the
Adriatic.</p>

<p>During August preparations were made by the Allied armies in northern
Italy to penetrate the heavily fortified Gothic Line. This defensive
system of the enemy extended in general from southeast of La Spezia
through the mountains to Rimini. After regrouping and building up
supplies, the Allied armies started their offensive on 26 August. They
succeeded in breaching the Gothic Line in the center and along the
coast, but fierce enemy resistance, bad weather, and a shortage of
ammunition and replacements halted the offensive south of the Po River
plain by the late fall of 1944. The winter of 1944–45 was spent in the
mountains overlooking the Po Valley.</p>

<p>The spring drive by the Allied armies started on 9 April 1945. Bologna
fell on 20 April, and armor and infantry overran the plain and divided
the German forces. On 2 May 1945 the enemy in Italy surrendered
unconditionally.</p>

The first snow fell in the mountains on 11 November. Snow,
rain, sleet, and ice-coated curves on the roads leading to the
front made the supply situation a difficult one. The constant
work by snowplows and the hand labor of thousands of soldiers
and Italian civilians kept the main roads open throughout the
winter.</p>

different mounts tested, one had 54 tubes placed on top of a
medium tank turret, another had 18 tubes mounted on the same
carriage as a towed 37-mm. gun. Because of the great variation
in deflection and range the weapon was not practical against
a point target and the smoke and flame given off when fired
tended to disclose its position. It proved effective for a heavy
concentration over a wide area for a short period. The short
range of the rocket, slightly less than 4,000 yards, was a
limiting factor. (Each cluster of 3 magnesium tubes is a rocket

1944–45 Allied officers, arms, and ammunition were dropped
behind the enemy lines to assist partisans in the Po Valley.
Although partisans, armed with equipment obtained from Italian
arsenals or seized from the Germans, first appeared north of
Rome, it was not until the Allies reached Bologna that they met
the efficiently organized groups from the Po Valley. As troops
entered the city, where the Germans were numerous, the partisans
struck, seizing government agencies and public utilities.</p>

forces during the winter. Later air reconnaissance found these
undamaged bridges at Bomporto. A task force, sent to secure
them, passed through the fleeing and disorganized enemy. So
sudden was its appearance that, by 1600 on 21 April, it captured
the bridges before the Germans could detonate previously laid
demolition charges.</p>

Germans to halt, reorganize, and make a determined stand behind
either the Po or the other rivers in the Po plain. Speedy
thrusts by infantry-armor columns split the enemy forces and
severed communications. After the crossing of the Po, the action
on both sides developed into a race to the Alps, the enemy
hoping to escape into Germany, the Allies determined to prevent
them. Many isolated pockets of resistance developed behind the
advancing columns and special task forces were organized on 23
April to deal with them.</p>

For the first time in the Italian campaign, the enemy was

Germans lacked vehicles and gasoline, they had to rely to a
great extent on horse-drawn transportation. They retreated
across an open valley having a fine network of roads for
mechanized forces and were forced to cross wide rivers by
ferries and ponton bridges under constant attack by Allied air
forces. The retreat became a rout.</p>

week later the war in Europe was concluded with complete victory
for the Allies. The Italian campaign had been a bitter one,
lasting 607 days (3 September 1943 to 2 May 1945). Casualties of
the Fifth Army, including all nationalities serving with that
army, totaled 188,546. United States losses were 19,475 killed,
80,530 wounded, and 9,637 missing.</p>

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.&#8221;

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

        distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works.
    </div>
</div>

forth in Section 3 below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
